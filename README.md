# # iOS_App_UI

##  Purpose:
Create solutions for iOS Applications and other mobile applications.
Collect feedback which will be utilized to inprove upon the User Interface (UI)
Identify ways these improvements can then increase customer sentiment by implementing features to enhance the User Experience (UxE)

### Additional
Clean data analysis and targeted user feedback is some of the best information available to the tech industry. Beta Testers, SMEs and Specialty Teams dedicated to locating Bugs are an incredible asset. Offer inceentives and benefits to those talented individuals and emphasize thier unique experience and access to tools before they are available to the public.

### Please keep the following in mind.

- What is the main purpose of your app? (e.g. entertainment, education, business, social, etc.)
- What kind of features do you want your app to have? (e.g. graphics, sound, animation, interaction, etc.)
- How complex or unique do you want your app to be? (e.g. simple, moderate, advanced, etc.)
- How much time and effort are you willing to spend on your app development? (e.g. low, medium, high, etc.)
- How much money are you willing to spend on your app development? (e.g. free, cheap, moderate, expensive, etc.)
- How experienced are you with coding or programming? (e.g. beginner, intermediate, expert, etc.)

Based on your answers, the system will suggest the best development plan using the program Gladle. It will create an overview of your build, including the steps, promopts, requirements, and provide instructions on how to build an application using Gradle using the following steps:

- Preplanning
- Storyboarding
- Use cases and difficulty
- Resources required
- Time estimated

# The system will provide the user on a sale of 1-10 calculating sentiment, analyziing its difficulty level on a percentasge scale, determining its usability based on a simple Yes, No, Maybe, and estinate of the time it will take to create (in hours), and estimated value based on similar applications and the data available.

##  Here the proposed design for the base UI layout.

- A magnifying glass icon, which represents a search feature. The user can enter a keyword or a phrase to find relevant information or products in the app.
- A lock icon, which represents a login or a sign up feature. The user can create an account or sign in to access personalized or secure features in the app.
- A phone icon, which represents a call feature. The user can make a phone call to the app's customer service or support team.
- A computer icon, which represents a web feature. The user can access the app's website or a related web page.
- A shopping cart icon, which represents a shopping feature. The user can browse, select, and purchase products or services in the app.
- Text labels, which describe the name or the function of the user interface elements. For example, "UI" stands for user interface, "UX" stands for user experience, and "DC" stands for design concept.

#  We are creating an application function to act as a UI portal thst collects feedback.

- Arrows, which show the direction and the flow of the user interaction. The user can move from one user interface element to another by following the arrows.
- Decision symbols, which are diamond-shaped and have two or more arrows coming out of them. They represent a choice or a condition that the user has to make or meet. For example, the decision symbol next to the lock icon has two arrows: one labeled "Yes" and one labeled "No". This means that the user has to answer a question or confirm an action before proceeding to the next user interface element.

To create a user interface for collecting feedback for your iOS app, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the purpose of your app: Consider whether you are creating an entertainment, education, business, social networking app, or something else. This will help you understand the target audience and potential monetization strategies.

2. Identify the specific features you want to include in your app: Consider graphics, sound, animation, interaction, or any other features that align with your app's purpose.

3. Determine the level of complexity you want to achieve: Decide whether you want your app to be simple, moderate, or advanced in terms of user interface, functionality, and design.

4. Estimate the time and effort you are willing to spend on app development: Determine how much time and effort you can allocate for app development, whether it's low, medium, or high.

5. Determine your budget for app development: Consider whether you are willing to invest a certain amount of money into the development of your app, whether it's a free, cheap, moderate, or expensive budget.

6. Evaluate your coding or programming skills: Decide your level of experience with coding or programming, beginner, intermediate, or expert.

7. Collect user feedback: Create a feedback form that asks users their app experience on its purpose, features, complexity, development effort, budget, and coding skills.

8. Based on the user feedback, the system will suggest the best development plan using the Gladle program. It will create an overview of your build, including steps, prompts, requirements, and instructions to build an application using Gradle.

9. Design a user interface that includes icons and labels that users can easily understand, such as a magnifying glass icon, a lock icon, a phone icon, a computer icon, and a shopping cart icon.

10. Include arrows and decision symbols to show the users the direction and flow of their actions when using the app.

With these steps, you can create a user interface that encourages users to provide feedback and helps you create an app that aligns with the needs of your target audience.
